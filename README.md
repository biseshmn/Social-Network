# Social-Network




With xampp v3.2.3

This project was created in VSCode with 'SCSS IntelliSense' and 'Live Sass Compiler' 
which helps to watch Sass codes in real time. 
A '.css' and a '.css.map' are automatically created.


* I created multiple view pages to minimize clutter.

* The main view page is named 'home.php'

* 'header.php' and 'footer.php' include codes for top header and footer respectively

* 'user.php' includes codes for left-most panel.

* 'recommendation.php' includes right-most panel.

* 'content.php' includes codes for middle panel.


* Bootstrap css and js files are stored locally in 'bootstrap5.2.1' folder.

* jquery.js and jquery.min.js are also stored locally in 'js' folder. A custom.js file
  is stored in the same folder.

* To minimize scss code, I used bootstrap classes and utilities as much as possible.

* 'override.css' file is for overridden bootstrap css.

* 'componets.css' file is for components that were frequently used. I also did not 
   create to many components to minimize lines of codes.

* Php files are linked using <?php include("header.php"); ?>

* Images are stored in 'images' folder. 


* This project was large so i tried to write comments as much as possible.

* a 1min30sec video is also included.


				Thank you.
